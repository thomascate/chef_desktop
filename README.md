# Chef Desktop

Chef Desktop is a batteries included way of managing your Windows or Mac desktop with Chef. It provides sane, secure defaults, and makes configuring your desktop a breeze.

## Running it with chef-zero

`cd chef_desktop/cookbooks`

`chef-client -z -o chef_desktop`

## Running it with our ChefDK fork
__NOTE__: This works with an experimental fork of chef-dk, check out
  https://github.com/talaris/chef-dk

```
git clone https://github.com/talaris/chef-dk.git ../chef-dk
cd ../chef-dk
bundle install
bundle exec chef desktop --cookbooks-path ../chef_desktop/cookbooks
```

## Philosophy

What it is:
- Use cases centered around single developer and small to medium sized organizations.
- Batteries included. Custom resources that need to be created for installing and managing popular packages are included by default and maintained by the community.
- Inheritance structure: You can specify a organization.rb with shared settings for your entire org (like which printers to install for example), then specify a department.rb with shared settings for your department, then specify a person.rb with your personal settings.
- Limited platform support: Supported on only the latest release of Mac and Windows. Previous versions of Mac and Windows may work, but safety is not guaranteed.
- Resource driven. Attributes will not be used.
- Will use policyfiles and chef 12.5 resource model.
- Will be local (chef-client -z)


What it is not:
- Supported on exotic platforms. If you're using Gentoo or RHEL for your **desktop**, you should know what you're doing on your own.
- Command & Control. Chef Desktop is not an enforcement mechanism for ensuring desktops in your enterprise are managed and dictatorially determining which apps your employees can install.
- Auditing desktops
- For large organizations.
- Attribute driven. Attributes are NOT flexible enough, have global state, have 14 different precedence levels, and are confusing in general.

## MVP

Mac
- Bootstrap
- Update system settings
- Install Homebrew
- Install Atom from Homebrew
- Install Atom plugins
- Make it sexy

## Why other solutions have failed so far

- They aren't simple enough to use -- too many levels of abstraction
- Abstractions are leaky -- require understanding the whole thing to make simple updates
- They don't work on Windows
- They support exotic desktop platforms and make compromises because of it
- They aren't batteries included and require too much work to get started.
- They use attribute or list driven customization and aren't flexible enough when needed
- They don't allow you to specify multiple sources for where packages come from
- They don't have a critical mass of support for popular installations
- The have confusing or un-googable names
- Not a frictionless experience
